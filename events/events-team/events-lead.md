# Events Lead Handbook

## Overview

The Event Lead is responsible for acting as a chair for the event, carrying out the strategic vision, and being the glue needed to execute on the event.

The Event Lead(s) is responsible for determining which core roles need to be filled at the start of planning for each event. After initial core team meetings, each lead will determine how to best staff for that function and fill in other roles. Each role will ideally have a shadow for succession planning. Those who have been a part of a previous event get first dibs on lead roles to maintain consistency.
