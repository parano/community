# Meet Our Contributors - Ask Us Anything!

When Slack seems like it’s going too fast, and you just need a quick answer from a human...

Meet Our Contributors gives you a monthly one-hour opportunity to ask questions about our upstream community, watch interviews with our contributors, and participate in peer code reviews.

## When:
Every first Wednesday of the month at the following times. Grab a copy of the calendar to yours from [kubernetes.io/community](https://kubernetes.io/community/)
* 02:30pm UTC [Convert to your timezone](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=02%3A30%20pm&tz=UTC&).
* 08:00pm UTC [Convert to your timezone](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=08%3A00%20pm&tz=UTC&).

Tune into the [Kubernetes YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/KubernetesCommunity/live) to follow along with video, check out our playlist of [previous Meet-Our-Contributors monthly meetings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL69nYSiGNLP3QpQrhZq_sLYo77BVKv09F) and join [#meet-our-contributors](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/meet-our-contributors) on Slack for questions and discussion.

## What You'll Gain By Participating:

* An opportunity to learn more about how to get started contributing to K8s
* A chance to get your PRs reviewed by members of the community
* Peer code review that can help you get more eyes on your code, or learn more about a part of the Kubernetes code that may have you struggling
* A deeper understanding of the unique role that our contributors occupy in the Kubernetes ecosystem as a whole
* Practical advice and hands-on tips for how you can get started as a Kubernetes contributor, become a member, or otherwise contribute to the project

## What’s on-topic:
* How our contributors got started with k8s
* Advice for getting attention on your PR
* GitHub tooling and automation
* Your first commit
* kubernetes/community
* Testing

## What’s off-topic:
* End-user questions (Check out [#office-hours](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/office-hours) on Slack and details [here](/events/office-hours.md))

## Submitting questions and/or code for review/walk through:
### Questions:
* Day of on Twitter - use the hashtag [#k8smoc](https://twitter.com/hashtag/k8smoc) after your question   
* Slack - Ask your question in [#meet-our-contributors](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/meet-our-contributors)


Questions will be on a first-come, first-served basis. The first half of the discussion will be dedicated to questions for contributors and in the second half, we will pick a problem (in advance) for peer code review.

### Code snip / PR for peer code review / Suggestion for part of codebase walk through:
* At least 24 hours before the session to Slack channel (#meet-our-contributors)

Problems will be chosen based on time commitment needed, the skills of the reviewer, and if a large amount are submitted, need for the project.

## Call for Volunteers:
Contributors - [sign up to answer questions!](https://goo.gl/uhEJ33)

Expectations of volunteers:
* Be online 5 minutes early. You can look at questions in the queue by joining the #meet-our-contributors Slack channel to give yourself some time to prepare.
* Expect questions about the contribution process, membership, navigating the Kubernetes seas, testing, and general questions about you and your path to open source/Kubernetes. It's okay if you don't know the answer!
* We will be using video chat (Zoom, but livestreaming through YouTube) but voice-only is fine if you are more comfortable with that.
* Be willing to provide suggestions and feedback to make this process & experience better!
